I played a pivotal role in the development of Prodago's core web application, employing React and .NET technologies.
As the lead developer for the frontend,
I not only spearheaded its creation but also made substantial contributions to the backend.

Currently, my focus is on a new Prodago productâ€”an AI engine poised to revolutionize the governance
process through automation. In this capacity, I am tasked with architecting the application and leading
its development. The venture into the AI domain has been a rich learning experience, particularly in navigating
the challenges of constructing a scalable and reliable AI SaaS application.
