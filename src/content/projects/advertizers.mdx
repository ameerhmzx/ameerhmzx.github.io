A static website? seriously? Well, yes.

## Introduction
In this portfolio piece, I showcase a seemingly simple project â€“ a static website.
While the technology and complexity might not stand out, the story behind it holds significance for me.

## Background
I embarked on this endeavor when a friend, starting a marketing agency, needed a website.
Despite being relatively new to web development, armed with basic HTML and CSS skills and some experience
with WordPress, I took on the challenge.

## The Journey
Building from scratch was a new experience. I had previously modified some templates and worked
with drag-and-drop builders, but creating a website from the ground up was uncharted territory.
Additionally, my knowledge was limited to traditional web development tools.

The discovery of TailwindCSS marked a turning point. Intrigued by its utility-first CSS approach,
I decided to delve into this modern framework. Having worked with Bootstrap in the past,
TailwindCSS presented a fresh challenge that I was eager to tackle.

Driven by the desire to learn, I embraced the unfamiliar and built the website using TailwindCSS.
This project not only showcases the end result but also serves as a reminder of the time when
I was a novice in the world of web development.

I learned a lot from this experience, other than building a website from scratch.
- The process of buying a domain name
- Setting up a server
- Configuring DNS records
- Setting up SSL certificates
- Deploying a static website
- Setting up the emails for the domain
- Setting up the CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

I was proud of the outcome while my friend was happy with the website.

While this static website may not be groundbreaking, its inclusion in my portfolio is a testament to my journey,
illustrating the transition from a newcomer in web development to someone who fearlessly takes on challenges
and embraces learning opportunities.
