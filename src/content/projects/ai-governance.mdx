# What is Prodago AI Governance?

You have products and services that need to be governed? Maybe with GDRP, CCPA, or other regulations?
Prodago provides you with the tool to assess the risks having

> Life Saving Clarity

You can implement those operating practices in your organization or project that will help you to comply with the regulations and mitigate risks.
Prodago also enables you to execute these practices and monitor the progress in a very user-friendly and collaborative way.

# How I contributed

## Project Takeover

I led a team of five developers in taking over a project from a previous team and successfully continued its development.
The application, built using React, TypeScript, Material UI, .Net Core, and Azure, required refactoring, performance optimization,
and cost reduction based on client feedback.

## Code Refactoring

To address the project's challenges, I implemented the following measures:
- Removed unused code and dependencies to streamline the codebase
- Updated dependencies to the latest versions and replaced unnecessary libraries with custom implementations
- Upgraded the project from Create React App (CRA) to Vite, reducing build time and bundle size
- Implemented atomic design principles and introduced Storybook for component management
- Developed a custom UI Kit based on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, integrated with a custom plugin for design tokens from Figma
- Introduced Nx workspace for efficient monorepo management as the application grew

## Infrastructure and Cost Optimization
To reduce costs, I:
- Migrated the project from Kubernetes to static web hosting on Azure, achieving 100% cost savings
- Implemented runtime environment variables, enabling a single build for deployment across different environments with varying configurations

## Process Improvement

- Introduced a new process for managing translations using a CMS tool, reducing the time spent on translation-related tasks by 20%
- Implemented trunk-based development and pull request reviews to ensure code quality and maintainability

# Lessons Learned

This project was the most complex and enterprise-level application I have worked on, providing valuable lessons in:
- Governance and compliance in software development
- Effective team management and leadership
- Cost optimization strategies
- Process improvements for high-quality software delivery
- Scaling and managing critical projects that drive business operations

> This experience has significantly enhanced my skills and expertise in delivering large-scale, business-critical software projects.
